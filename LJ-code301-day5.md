## Learning Journa Day5

Today was a little tougher than most, but it was okay.  Both Sam and TA Ron were out sick.  We split into our teams and did the
best we could on the lab, but we found it very difficult.  Sam then uploaded a link to the class video from his previous 301
course, and that turned out to be sufficient enough to get the job done!  Cool.  Paried programming on our portfolio pages
went well, I was able to get my tabbed requirement completed and also my drop down menues and nave bar controll fixed. 
AWESOME!!  Thnaks Adrienne and Ron!
