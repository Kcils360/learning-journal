Today we started the 301 course.  It was a great week off after 201, but i'm super excited to be back at this.  The topic
for the day was responsive web design and the design elements that make it possible.  Specifically the concept of using
percentages instead of hard pixels for widths, along with the viewport meta tag and media-querries.
