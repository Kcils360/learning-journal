Well folks, today was tough.

I REALLY REALLY like seeing the power and grace of jQuery.  It's so much cleaner than vanilla JS, and I can see and
conceptulaize the syntax fairly easily.  Can I impliment it myself?  Heck no at all.  Today proved that.  This class
seems to be following a trend of here, look at sort of what were doing, no go do it on your own.  I don't learn that way.
I need to be walked thru a concept, sort of a driver/navigator situation, so I can grasp what I'm doing and feel confident 
in the content before getting pushed out on my own.  The classic "excercise" model.  I don't know.  Maybe it was just lack
of sleep had my brain sluggish.  We'll see how tomorrow goes.
