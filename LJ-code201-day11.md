Today we briefly touched on adding audio and video to a page.  Very briefly, which is a bummer because I would like to have
spent a little more time going over this.  The main part of class today was adding a click tracker to further manipulate the 
DOM.  using document.getElementById to have JS 'listen' to something on the HTML page.  This is cool stuff and I can already 
think of a ton of use-cases for this to make awesome responsive web pages.  Cool stuff today.
