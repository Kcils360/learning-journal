Today we talked about debugging.  While I fairly quickly grasped the concept of top-down loading, it was cool to learn that JS
actually runs thru the script once before executing the scripts.  Of course, it seems obvious that it would.  Load up any 
variables on the first pass so they can be quickly called upon during execution.  Makes total sense.  Understanding this means
I can better use the built in tools to debug where any issues may be creeping up.  Using console.logs and breaks will be
the two most used ways I will be able to debug going forward.
