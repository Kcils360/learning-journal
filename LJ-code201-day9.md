Today the main topic was wireframing with CSS.  I think this is going to be an extremely useful tool for me because while I love adding color and pics to style my page, my layouts always seem flat, lame.  I hope to spend some of my free time mocking up some wireframes I can use as templates later on.  Really good stuff today.
