Today the main topic was page layout and overall styling with CSS.  This is one of my favorite aspects of web design.  Admitedly
I'm not very artistic, so my designs are not very inspired or particularly unique, but I very much enjoy playing with the colors
and borders and transparancy on a web page.  I think what I like about CSS is it is very straight forward.  It doesn't take as
much algorythmic manipulation to make the page look the way I see it in my head.  I like CSS and I hope to be using a lot of it 
in the coming weeks.
