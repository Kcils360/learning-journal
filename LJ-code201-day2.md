# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Today we started the morning off by covering in depth the basic concepts of HTML, CSS, and Javascript from the books.  I got some good notes about structure and when to correctly use which elements in my HTML document.

After lunch, we really got into writing code.  We learned how to connect git to atom and the ACP process using the terminal, and then wrote some code that created an about-me page whith which we flexed our CSS muscles to show what we already know.  In this page we created a basic Javascript game with prompts and answers about ourselves as well while explicitly avoiding functions....which we will learn on another day.

This here learning journal was also another product of the projects for today.  Adult-learning is highly augmented by journeling what one learns, so here we are.
