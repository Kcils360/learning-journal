today was presentation day.  It went really well, as smooth as could be expected.  the guys had even set up a demo of going to
in the off chance that it didn't happen during the live demo, so that was cool.  It was remarkable to me that there didn't seem
to be much difference between the 301 projects and our 201 projects except theirs included DB APIs and they focused on mobile
view as well.  In fact, I think some of ours looked better.  Anyway, maybe i'm just biased.  All I know is my classes 301
projects are goin to be fire af.
