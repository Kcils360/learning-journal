## Learning Journal Day 15

Toady was the last day of class and the first day of projects.  My team came up with an idea pretty quickly and go damn near
an MVP before we left for the long weekend.  There is still a bit of tweeking to do with the information that gets put
 on our map, but we have an API calling info, and that info going onto a map.  The rest of the week will be gravy!
