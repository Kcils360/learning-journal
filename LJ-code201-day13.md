Today we discussed a little more about page layout, specifically the users interaction with it.  UI/UX and what a good page
would look like.  We briefly discussed design trends, what's currently hot, what pages might look like in a few years.
The overall idea is that the page should be designed with the user in mind.  To make it aestheticly pleasing whlie still
delivering content and important information.  We then talked about local storage, and using local storage to create
persistance.  Persistance is the webpages ability to remember states after resets and browser restarts.  Really cool stuff.
We added local storage capability to our click-tracker webpage which would continue to track total clicks thru multiple
itarations of the survey.
