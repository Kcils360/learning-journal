## Learning Journal Day 8

Today we started our adventures in SQL. The lab was to look at some starter code already in place and understand what
was going on.  Yet again, I'm reminded that I can pretty easily grasp the concepts, i just have a hard time with correct
syntax.  It's still pretty cool though, and I'm excited to learn more server and database code.
