Today was the last class of lectures.  The last class before project week.  Sadly, I had to leave early.  We talked about
the assigned reading, an article about what Google learned about effective groups.  My takeaway from the discussion
was basicly that the most effective groups are genreally more empathetic with eachother, let everyone participate equally, 
and usually have a positive attitude toward the work and toward eachother.  I will be working on these things myself as project
week progresses.
