Toaday we discussed domain modeling.  The basic idea is to create a small function that is really good at creating 
a number of objects with similar attributes.  Naming this function with a capital letter lets JS know that it is a constructor
and you can then add functions, called methods, to it using the cunstructor prototype tag.  I'm pretty comfortable using the 
constructor to make basic objects but I'm still not sure how to attach methods with the prototype.
