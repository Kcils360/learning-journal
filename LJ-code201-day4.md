# LJ Code 201 Day4

Today was the first day we really got into paired programming.  I really like the process of the driver and navigator, and working with somebody to collaborate on one code.  I'm looking forward to doing more of that in the coming weeks.  We also got into functions, and using functions to reduce code.  DRY, as it were.  So that's cool.  Currently, my code is still broken, but with the new functions layer, I think figuring it out will fairly straight forward.  

We continue to add to our CSS knowlede base, covering the box model, float, and positions.  We talked about relative, absolute, static, and fixed.  This was a big couple of days, I learned a lot and I'm looking forward to Friday.
