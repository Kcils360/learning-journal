Today was the third day of project week.  The group has been blasting thru, rockin' socks.  We are very nearly done, just need
tweek a few final UI/UX details.  We will definately be ready to present on Friday.  i feel surprisingly comfortable with my 
unerstanding of the code that is in our project.  In only three weeks of study,  I can build this project.  Amazing.
